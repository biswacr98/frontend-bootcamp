<!--
General structure:
<tagname attribute_name="attribute_value">Content</tagname>

The attribute name is always followed by an equal sign and the attribute value is always enclosed in double quotes.
There are no spaces between the attribute name, the equal sign, and the attribute value.
-->

<!--
Anchor Elements/ Hyperlinks:

Using the anchor tag, we can connect a HTML page to another HTML page or a resource on the internet.

The href attribute refers to Hypertext Reference, whose value is the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the page or resource we want to link to.

The href attribute can also refer to things like:
- an email address (mailto:someone@gmail.com)
- a phone number (tel:1234567890)
- documents/files (give url of the file instead of a web page)
- another different location on the same web page the browser is currently on (use # followed by the id of the element)

<!--
Absolute URL Path:

An absolute URL points to a single address that will direct to the same page regardless of where the original page is coming from.

Looks like: http://www.github.com/google

Three parts:

1. Protocol: http://, https://, ftp://, file:// etc.
2. Domain: www.github.com (the address of the server or the name of the website)
3. Path: The directory or folder we wish to navigate to. This field is not always necessary and generally allows to navigate to a more specific portion of a domain. (in this case, google's profile on github)

Absolute URL will not change its destination if used on different devices/browsers.

-->

<!--
Relative URL Path:

Relative URLs provide less information than absolute URLss and generally refer to pages on the same domain.
Useful when we start to deal with multiple web pages on your site, and want a way to navigate between them.
