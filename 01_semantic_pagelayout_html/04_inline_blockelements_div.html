    <p>This is a block-level element. It takes up width of the page</p>
    <p>This element (also block-level), is rendered a line below the previous element</p>

        <strong>Inline elements</strong> often times exist <em>within</em> block-level elements

<!--
Block level elements:
- Take up the full width of the page, especially creating a "block" around the content you place within that element.
- Start on a new line of the web page.
- Headings (h1-h6), paragraphs (p), divs (div), lists (ul, ol), and sections (section) are examples of block-level elements.

-->

<!--
Inline elements:
- Do not take up the full width of the page and are generally "in-line" with the text content.
- Do not start on a new line of the web page.
- Anchors (a), images (img), emphasizing text (em) and spans (span) are examples of inline elements.
-->

<!--
Divs:

- Divs are block-level elements that are used to group content together.
- Divs allow us to section into seperate, logical divisions of the web page.
- Divs seperate content into different sections, making it easier to style and manipulate the content.
- Generally, we nest other HTML elements within divs to group them together and provide structure to our page.
