One of the properties of HTML elements is to be nested. HTML elements can exist within other HTML elements.
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page, and all other elements are nested within it.
The <head> and <body> elements are nested within the <html> element.
The <title> element is nested within the <head> element, and the <h1> and <p> elements are nested within the <body> element.

This give us a tree-like structure of elements, where the <html> element is the root of the tree, and all other elements are branches or leaves of the tree.
This structure is called the Document Object Model (DOM), and it is the foundation of how web pages are created and manipulated.

<!--
The head may contain metadata, such as the title of the page, links to stylesheets, and scripts.
The body contains the content of the page, such as text, images, and other media. Only one <body> element is allowed in an HTML document.
